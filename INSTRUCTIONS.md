# Frontend Developer Technical Test

This task is designed to evaluate your skills in **React**, **Next.js**, **Typescript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **animation libraries** such as **GSAP** or **Framer Motion**. You will build a small application that fetches data from a public API and presents it with engaging animations and a responsive UI.

## Project Requirements

### Tech Stack:
- **React with Next.js**
- **Typescript**
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **GSAP** or **Framer Motion** for animations

### Features to Implement:
1. Fetch data from a public API (e.g., [Free Test API](https://freetestapi.com/apis)).
2. Display a list of fetched data on the home page in a structured and user-friendly way.
3. Add filtering or searching functionality to allow users to refine the list based on a specific criterion.
4. Provide a detail page for each item in the list (using Next.js dynamic routes). On this page, fetch and display additional data related to the item.


### Extra Points:
- Implement loading states for the API calls (e.g., spinners or skeleton loaders).
- Implement up to two different types of animations using **GSAP** or **Framer Motion** (e.g., on element appearance, interaction, or transitions).
- Deploy the application (e.g., using **Vercel**) and provide a link.

## Getting Started

To get started, fork this repository and clone it to your local environment. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed, and then install the dependencies as you need.

Refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information on how to work with Next.js or the README.md file for the project setup.
